#ZLab

ZLab (wizzlab) is a no-code environment that makes it simple to run automated task chains in a home enviornment. ZLab will initially run locally using node, but eventually will have allow a local bridge/server to run and be controlled by a cloud env.

ZLab was inspired by the needs of small event management due to a lack of comparable platforms in the market.

**Layout** is a drag and drop enviornment. Similar to respell.ai where you can add modules/components and string/connect the inputs and outputs together.
