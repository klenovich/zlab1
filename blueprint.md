# ZLab

**ZLab (wizzlab)** is a no-code environment that makes it simple to run automated task chains in a home enviornment. ZLab will initially run locally using node, but eventually will have allow a local bridge/server to run and be controlled by a cloud env.

**ZLab** was inspired by the needs of small event management due to a lack of comparable platforms in the market.

**Layout** is a drag and drop enviornment. Similar to respell.ai where you can add modules/components and string/connect the inputs and outputs together.

**Example modules/components:**
- Philips WiZ lights api
- connection to Ardruino/Pi devices that act as decible and temperature probes
- Spotify api
- Graphics generator

**Possible IoT devices:**
- Decibel probes
- Temperature probes
- Companion device that controls speakers and outputs audio
- Hardware controllers for AC units

**Example combinations:**
- connected temperature probes that are set to run a task at a certain temperature, might involve turning on an ac unit
- decibel probes that decrease volume on a device controlling speakers
- spotify api integration that changes conencted light colors to music and generates a graphics feed
